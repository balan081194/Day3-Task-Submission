Window is the main JavaScript object root,the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. 
The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
The Window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
•	screen properties width and height are the full screen
•	screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
